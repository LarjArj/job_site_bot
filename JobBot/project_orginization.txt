Goal Of Project

Create a bot that scrapes job postings on Indeed.com(for now, maybe more in the future) 
based on user input. For instance, if a user inputs "Software Engineer" or "Accountant" or
"Attorney" as "Job Title". This will scrape those postings and give the user a statistical 
summary of the most frequent phrases and keywords. This will allow the user to focus on skills,
requirments or other points of interest that are relavant to their industry, basically giving them 
a glimpse into what employers are looking for instead of having to manually scroll through listing 
after listing. This is most ideal for those in techincal careers which require being up to date on the
latest trends, technologies and paradigms, but can be used for anyone.



High Level Structure of Project


1) Traversal of indeed.com with selenium

Associated Files - indeedBot.py

Working well for the most part, however there is still some error/exception handling needed
. Cannot completely avoid Captcha and inherent anti scraping mechanisms of indeed.com
However, provided the user is responsible and keeps time ranges in that are more less akin to 
a human user would traverse a website, this code should work fine

2) extraction of keywords and phrases  
Assoicated Files- NLP.py  , parse.py, patterns.py

Sucessful Implementation of core ideas, however there may be some ineffeciences 
and irregularities that may need to be adressed 


3) statisical findings of extracted text 
Associated Files- statistics_graphing.py

- not much done here yet

4) Graphing/Presentation -
Assoicated Files- statistics_graphing.py

- not much done here yet



5) Some functionality to handle frequency by which user allows script to requirments and 
link to email to eventually send results
Assoicated Files- None Yet

6) Simple but elegant UI tying everything together
Assoicated Files- None Yet


Basically So Far I have a good understandning of what I the project to accomplish,
but now I need to tie everything together and take care of some ireegualrities
throughout the different stages of the project
